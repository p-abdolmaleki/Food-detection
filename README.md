# Food detection

- In this repository, the implementation of a convolutional model for food recognition on this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parsaabdolmaleki/food-images) has been discussed.
- Already has used transfer learning, and two models, VGG 19 and Inception, have been used and tested as basic models.
- Since the Inception model has a better performance, an attempt has been made to control overfit and increase its accuracy.
- Using data augmentation methods can improve the performance of the model. (since the dataset is not balanced and clean).
